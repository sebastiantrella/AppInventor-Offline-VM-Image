AppInventor-Offline-VM-Image
============================

This is an VirtualBox VM running Ubuntu and all AppInventor Services, so you can use AppInventor without Internet Connection.
As GitHub is not the right place to store large files like this VM we needed to move it somewhere else. Please contact us via info@trella.net to get the link to Download the VM.
